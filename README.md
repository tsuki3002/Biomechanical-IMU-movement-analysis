# Biomechanical Movement Classification Using IMU Sensors and Machine Learning

A machine learning system that classifies lower body exercises using data from 6 IMU sensors, implementing four different ML models to analyze biomechanical movement patterns.

## üìå Project Overview

### Research Question
**Can machine learning correctly classify lower body movements based on 3D acceleration sensor readings?**

### Key Achievements
- Implemented 4 ML models (SVM, Naive Bayes, RNN, KNN) for movement classification
- Achieved up to 100% accuracy on test data
- Developed a comprehensive sensor data processing pipeline
- Identified optimal sensor placements for movement analysis

## üìä Dataset & Methodology

### Sensor Configuration
- 6 IMU sensors (3 per lower extremity)
- 40Hz sampling rate
- 3D acceleration data (x, y, z planes)

### Exercises Classified
1. Standing
2. Squats
3. Right split squats
4. Left split squats
5. Right lateral lunges
6. Left lateral lunges

### Data Collection
- 8 participants
- Minimum 6 repetitions per exercise
- 12,507 total records

## üß† Machine Learning Models

| Model | Accuracy | Key Strengths | Limitations |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Support Vector Machine** | 97% | Excellent for small datasets, effective feature comparison | Limited scalability |
| **Naive Bayes** | 99.36% | Probabilistic approach, handles patterns well | Potential overfitting concerns |
| **Recurrent Neural Network** | 100% | Captures temporal dependencies | Requires more data, overfitting risk |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors** | - | No assumptions about data | Less optimal for known movement patterns |


## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Highlights

### Key Technical Challenges
- Sensor data synchronization
- 3D movement pattern extraction
- Temporal dependency handling
